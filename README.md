## Overview

You can use this shiny app to compute simple generalized linear mixed-effects models with binomial or count data as the response variable.

## Features

-   You can specify the effect size for each predictor term as a Odds Ratio.

-   A reference table helps you set your Odds ratios based on their equivalence to the traditional Cohen's d effect sizes (small, medium, large).

-   You can specify the overall model intercept and the variability for the random effect terms (subject and trials).

-   You get a CSV and a RDS file with a time stamped table of the results, so you can share as open science materials (for example, as supporting materials for a preregistration).

-   You get a plot of the power curve along with the recommended sample size (subjects) based on a reliable criterion for the estimated power (i.e. lower bound of the 95% CI for power estimated at a given sample size).
